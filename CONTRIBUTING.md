# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. While working on your branch, don't merge master into your branch. Instead, rebase on master, to preserve a clean project history.
3. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
4. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
5. Squash your commits. Your (only) commit should be clear and self explanatory
   (check [those guidelines](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53))
6. Once the Pull Request created, you may assign the project maintainer for the review process. Once the PR approved, he'll merge it for you (in case you do not have permission to do that)
